# Help! App

Help! is an app that displays emergency information for users that are registered in our database.

# Setting up

To run locally:

Help! uses Node.js as well as Express, and stores it's user information in a MongoDB database. 

First, check that you have node and npm installed.
```
    $ node -v
```

```
    $ npm -v
```
  
Then, clone the repo and cd into the new directory's location on your machine.
```
   $ git clone 
   $ cd root/Help-App
```   

Finally, install dependencies, and start the server.
```   
   $ npm install
   $ npm start
```

Navigate to localhost:3000, and the app should be running in the browser.

If you need any help :wink: or if there are any issues :rage2: please don't hesitate to contact me on here, or submit an issue.

Thanks!
